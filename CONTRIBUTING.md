### Pre-commit Hooks

We use pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality and consistency. Our pre-commit configuration includes:

1. **Code Formatting**:
   - `black`: Python code formatter
   - `isort`: Python import sorter
   - `prettier`: JavaScript/HTML/CSS formatter

2. **Linting**:
   - `flake8`: Python linter
   - `eslint`: JavaScript linter
   - `pylint`: Python static code analyzer

3. **Security**:
   - `bandit`: Python security linter
   - `detect-secrets`: Prevents committing secrets and credentials

To manually run all pre-commit hooks:
```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

To update hooks to their latest versions:
```bash
pre-commit autoupdate
```

### CSS/Tailwind

We use Tailwind CSS for styling our application. Follow these guidelines:

1. **Class Organization**:
   - Group related utilities (e.g., all spacing utilities together)
   - Order utilities consistently: layout â†’ typography â†’ visual styles â†’ interactivity
   ```html
   <!-- Good -->
   <div class="flex items-center space-x-4 text-lg font-bold text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800">

   <!-- Bad -->
   <div class="text-blue-600 flex space-x-4 hover:text-blue-800 items-center text-lg font-bold">
   ```

2. **Responsive Design**:
   - Use mobile-first approach
   - Apply responsive prefixes consistently
   ```html
   <div class="w-full md:w-1/2 lg:w-1/3">
   ```

3. **Dark Mode**:
   - Always include dark mode variants
   - Use semantic color naming
   ```html
   <div class="bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100">
   ```

4. **Custom Components**:
   - Use @apply for repeated utility patterns
   - Create component classes in `tailwind.config.js` for common patterns
   ```css
   @layer components {
     .btn-primary {
       @apply bg-blue-600 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white px-6 py-2 rounded-lg;
     }
   }
   ```

5. **Theme Configuration**:
   - Use theme colors defined in `tailwind.config.js`
   - Extend theme using semantic naming
   ```javascript
   // tailwind.config.js
   module.exports = {
     theme: {
       extend: {
         colors: {
           primary: colors.blue,
           secondary: colors.gray,
           accent: colors.teal,
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

6. **Performance**:
   - Use JIT (Just-In-Time) mode
   - Purge unused styles in production
   - Keep utility combinations reasonable

7. **Accessibility**:
   - Include proper focus states
   - Use sufficient color contrast
   - Add hover/focus states for interactive elements
   ```html
   <button class="focus:ring-2 focus:ring-offset-2 focus:ring-blue-500 focus:outline-none">
   ```
